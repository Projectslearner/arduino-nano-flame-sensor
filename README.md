### Flame Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Flame Sensor project enables the detection of flames using an Arduino Nano and a flame sensor module. This project is designed for applications where the presence of flames needs to be monitored, such as fire detection systems or safety devices.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Flame Sensor Module**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram



#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Flame Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the digital output pin of the flame sensor module to digital pin 2 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the VCC pin of the flame sensor module to the 5V pin on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the GND pin of the flame sensor module to the GND pin on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the flame sensor module to the Arduino Nano according to the circuit setup.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer using a USB cable.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Select the appropriate board (Arduino Nano) and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - After uploading the code, open the serial monitor.
   - Observe the messages indicating the presence or absence of flames.

#### Applications

- **Fire Detection:** Used in fire alarm systems and devices to detect the presence of flames.
- **Safety Systems:** Integrated into safety equipment to trigger alarms or shutdown procedures in case of fire hazards.

#### Notes

- Ensure proper wiring and connection between the flame sensor module and the Arduino Nano.
- Adjust sensitivity settings or thresholds as needed for specific applications.
- Test the system in controlled environments to validate its performance and reliability.
